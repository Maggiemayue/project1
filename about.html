            <h3>Sigmund</h3>
            <p> Sigmund (she/her) is a powerhouse of rhythm and creativity. 
                Growing up in the vibrant city of New Orleans, she was immersed 
                in a world of jazz, blues, and soul from a young age. This rich 
                musical tapestry inspired her to pick up the drums at age nine, 
                and she's never looked back since. A graduate of Berklee College
                of Music, Sigmund is known for her dynamic percussion skills, 
                effortlessly blending traditional beats with contemporary flair. 
                But her talents don't end there. Sigmund is also a gifted 
                songwriter, lending her poetic touch to many of "Harmony of 
                Hearts'" hit songs. Her charismatic stage presence, combined 
                with her unmatched rhythmic prowess, makes her an indispensable 
                part of the band. Off the stage, Sigmund is a passionate 
                advocate for mental health awareness, using her platform to

            <h3>Dillon</h3>
            <p>
                Dillon (she/her) has always danced to the beat of her own guitar
                strings. Hailing from the sun-kissed coasts of California, she 
                found solace in the soothing rhythms of the ocean and the 
                melodies of classic rock echoing from beachside bonfires. By the 
                age of twelve, Dillon had already mastered the guitar, drawing 
                inspiration from legends like Hendrix and Clapton. Studying at 
                the California Institute of the Arts, she honed her skills, 
                blending traditional rock with a touch of modern indie. As the 
                lead guitarist of "Harmony of Hearts," Dillon's riveting solos 
                and intricate riffs add depth and dimension to the band's sound. 
                Offstage, she's an advocate for environmental causes, often 
                rganizing beach clean-ups and promoting sustainable living. Her 
                passion for music is only rivaled by her commitment to leaving 
                the world better than she found it.</p>
